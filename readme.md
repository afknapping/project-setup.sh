# what does it do?

* asks for a name or working title for the project
* sets up folderstructure in ~/projects/my-shiny-new-project
* creates gemset
* installs rake, bundler, heroku
* adds public key to heroku
* writes .rvmrc, notes and readme files in the projects base directory.

the idea is to have *some* rvm-enviroment, whatever happensâ€¦

# thanks
